## Purpose

This is an ongoing proccess of a search engine esc type of webapp, basically the goal is to inform people through articles that truly refelect the middle east, rather than relying on western propaganda, we aim to show the truth, and what the news in the middle east actually is like! Too often, global narratives are shaped externally. Our goal is to create a search engine that centers local reporting, amplifies underrepresented voices, and gives users direct access to how events are framed and understood within the region.
